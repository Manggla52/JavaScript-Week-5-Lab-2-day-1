JavaScript Week 5 Lab 2/day-1
[x]Create your own webpage with at least 3 pages and 3 js script files. (4 pages if you include index.html)

[]Each page should have a header paragraph and button. The button will use JavaScript to change the text of the header and paragraph by changing its innerHTML.

[]Add an index.html page to link your pages together in a nav.

[]Bonus: Feel free to spruce things up with CSS or to add more tags you'd like to change.

[]Bonus: exercise your skill by adding a little math or string template magic to your page. Get creative and have fun

[]If you don't understand why or how this works, that's OK. Just know we will delve deeper into functions and events later in the class.
